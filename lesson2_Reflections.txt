What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git init creates the .git directory thus making it a repository,
	which is required to use any of the git functionality.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	it's like a temp repository, and used to store thing in 
	a middle place between the repository and the working directory
	it's useful when you have second thoughts in which files to add
