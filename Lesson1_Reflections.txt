How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	The diff between two files is a great way to see the error
	a typo can be easily spotted within minutes just by skimming
	and even if the error wasn't a typo it is sure a lot easier
	to find by comparing an old working version to the new non-working
	one
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It's like having a backup of Ur work always with U, whenever
	U made a mistake, U can just roll back to a previous working
	version, also U can revise Ur work as it progresses one step
	at a time, learning from Ur mistakes U eventually learn how
	to build Ur apps faster
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pros : U get to choose when to commit making Ur history
	easier to read and Ur versions more defined
	cons: u might forget to commit resulting in hard to 
	understand versions, or even lost data
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	No project consisits of a single file, so To store code
	U must store the numerous connected files creating this
	code
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log shows the history of Ur commits with some data
	about them
	git diff compares 2 versions of the same file
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	if i break sth, i can simply checkout a previous verison
	and even i can use diff to know where did i go wrong
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
