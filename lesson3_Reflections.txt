When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Local data are prone to be lost, U always want to keep your data remotely
  unless it's something confidential
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  because i might be working on a new feature
