When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Local data are prone to be lost, U always want to keep your data remotely
  unless it's something confidential
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  because i might be working on a new feature
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  clone : copy the repo from one place to another along with all of its history and branches
  fork : copy the repo from git hub's servers to git hub's servers
  branch : create another project out of the main project
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  To be able to resume your work offline, and check the edits
  done by the contributers without needing to fix all merge conflicts
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  removable media like CDs and such, what would be easier is not having
  to write all those commands, also not having to stick with a certain work flow
  what would be harder is that merging the code base especially if
  it's a large one would not be practical, even can be impossible
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  when working on Ur own project it's easier to work on the master
  branch as U tend to solve conflicts as U go. however, while working
  with other people U would want every one to stay informed about the
  changes in the code so no one is surprised so U use brances and
  pull requests.
